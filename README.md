# Expense-tracker-with-LLM-and-custom-ML-model
What it involves: Collecting a dataset of expense sentences → labeling them with categories → training a text classification model (e.g., fine-tuning BERT, DistilBERT, or even a smaller LLM).  Pros:  Fully custom → can adapt to your own categories like Subscriptions, Rent, Groceries, EMI, etc.  Once trained, it runs locally and cheaply.
